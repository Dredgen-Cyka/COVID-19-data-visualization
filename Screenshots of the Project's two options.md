# Screenshots of the Project's two options.

## Figure 1. 
### Option 1 was chosen

#### The screenshot is a simple visualization using two bar charts and two plots which contain New Daily Cases (Linear plot), Cumulative Cases (Linear plot) , New Daily Deaths (Bar Chart), and Cumulative Deaths (Linear plot).

#### This option should pop up after you enter your Name, the state of your choice (Not Case Sensitive), and selecting '1' as the option.

### Option 2 was chosen

#### The screenshot demonstrates how the script functions, what it does and what you should see as a visualization for the Map, for example I chose to do Texas. From here you can see a mouse cursor above "Harns" County, which also displays a text box containing cumulative deaths and cases.
